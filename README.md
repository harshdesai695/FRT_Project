# Project Statement
Now a days buying products online is at boom. Customers prefer buying products online rather then buying it from a store. It has a lot of benefits like you don’t have to go anywhere to buy your favourite product, you can order just with the help of mobile phone or laptop and it gets delivered at your desired place without any problem.
But it has some drawbacks too. Like whenever we search for any product, we get a lot of recommendations or ads of different company’s websites with different prices of product. So, this ends up taking a lot of time of the consumers. Customers get confused whether to buy it from this website or any other website, which websites pricing is better.
So, the aim of our project is to create a website to showcase different types of electronic products. 

# Project Description

To solve the problem which we discussed, So I come up with "SHOPNOW", here you will find the best price of your electronic product at one place.

For example: Once the users search for any product with the help of shopnow, he or she can view the best price of that product from companies like Flipcart, Vijaysales, Shopclues, Fundamental.in at shopnow itself and once he clicks on the item, he will be redirected to the respected company website. With the help of this the user will not get confused between many things, but will also save his/her time.

So firstly, I have creacted a flask api using python which webscrap data from different websites and return a response in Json format then we have developed a website in reactjs which renders the response sent by  our Api , I aM using Reactjs as it creates a single page application and will also help to break the website into different components resulting into code reusability which will make our task much simpler.

I have used 4 different companies (Flipcart, Vijaysales, Shopclues, Fundamental.in) from we fetch the data using our Api.
